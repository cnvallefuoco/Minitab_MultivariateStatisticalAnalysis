# Overview

Courtney Datin and I worked as partners to analyze movie theme data. The motivation for this analysis was to create a model that allows us to group people based on what types of movies they like, their age, and their gender. The class conducted a survey of 82 subjects and 62 variables including movie themes, age, and gender. We ran a Principal Component, Factor, and Cluster Analysis to identify correlations and prove hypotheses with statistical modeling in Minitab.
